class Tracer
  # Represents the various options and controls associated with a variable
  # being traced. The #trace attr holds the actual data. The Var object
  # references the original object, and will therefore keep it from being GC-ed.
  # If you want to retain the data without the object, keep only the #trace.
  class Var
    # Type affects precision and storage size. Can be any of the following
    # strings, which are the same as the NArray scalar types:
    #
    #   "byte"   ::   1 byte unsigned integer
    #   "sint"   ::   2 byte signed integer
    #   "int"    ::   4 byte signed integer
    #   "sfloat" ::   single precision float
    #   "float"  ::   double precision float

    # memory is allocated. Each chunk is a +Vector+; the list of chunks is
    # a ruby array. This only needs to be adjusted for performance tuning.
    attr_reader :chunk_size

    # does an empty array. A value of [d1, d2...] indicates multidimensional

    # added to the trace.
