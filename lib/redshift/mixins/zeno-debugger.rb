class RedShift::World

  # Include this module in a World class. See example in examples/zeno.rb. Has a
  # very small performance cost, so don't use it in production runs. Note that,
  # even without ZenoDebugger, RedShift will still detect zeno problems by
  # raising a ZenoError when world.zeno_counter > world.zeno_limit, if
  # zeno_limit >= 0.
  #
  # ZenoDebugger is compatible with other kinds of debuggers.
