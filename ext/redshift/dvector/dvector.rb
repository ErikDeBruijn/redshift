# A linear collection of objects, like Array.
#
# Intended primarily for access from C code, using the inline
# rs_dv_push() and rs_dv_pop() functions.
#
# Implements some of the same methods as Array, but not all.
#
# Like an Array, a DVector grows implicitly as elements are
# pushed. But unlike an Array, a DVector shrinks only explicitly.
# This is to minimize realloc() calls when a DVector rapidly
# grows and shrinks.
