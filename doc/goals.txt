These are the goals that drive the design of the discrete and continuous update algorithms:

1. Independence on component ordering.

  This is why any number of transitions, related or unrelated, can be in
  progress at the same time.

2. Emulation of simultaneity.

  Possible to synchronize

3. Scalable.

  Another reason for the overlap of transitions--reduces guard evaluations.

4. Loosely coupled

  Suitable for simulation as opposed to control development
  
  Reason for non-blocking events.
