# Tests strictly continuous and strictly constant variables. Tests strict
# link variables.
#
# - tests that guard optimization works: guards are eval-ed once per step
#
# - tests exceptions raised by assigning to strict vars
#
# - tests exception raised by a transition to a state that algebraically
#   defines a variable in an inconsistent way
#
# [Note: exceptions caused by algebraically defining a strict var
#  in terms of a non-strict var are caught at compile time. See
#  test_strictness_error.rb. Similarly, a reset on a strict var can
#  be caught at compile time. See test_strict_reset_error.rb.]
