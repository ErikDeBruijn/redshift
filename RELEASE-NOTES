redshift 1.2.1

- Revised structure of discrete step. May break some code.

redshift 1.1.59

- Optimization: use diff_list in step_continuous to scan just those components
  that have diff flows.

- Improved bechmark framework and outputs; added new benchmarks.

redshift 1.1.58

- Event values may now be C exprs. Use #literal to force literal string/proc.

redshift 1.1.57

- Changed behavior when leaving state in which var is defined by alg flow,
  and entering state with no alg flow.

- Resets are now allowed in algebraic state, even if the reset value will be
  overridden by the next alg evaluation.

redshift 1.1.56

- Misc fixes, cleanup, and tests.

redshift 1.1.55

- Re-fixed bug with order in which guards are checked.

- Defaults and setup clauses can take a hash of var=>value, as can variable
  declarations.

redshift 1.1.54

- Fixed bug with transition S=>S and strict guards.

- Fixed bug with order in which guards are checked.

redshift 1.1.53

- Fixed bug with both link.contvar and link.constant in one gaurd expr.

- Fixed bug: strict link to nonstrict variable was treated as strict.

- Optimization: strict guards checked less often. (See bench/half-strict.rb.)

redshift 1.1.52

- Added bench/half-strict.rb.

redshift 1.1.51

- Added NonStrictLink test to test_strict_continuity.rb.

redshift 1.1.50

- Optimization: algebraic flows that are current at end of step_continuous
  don't need to be evaled until d_tick > 1.

redshift 1.1.49

- Minor optimization: strict alg. vars in a non-strict alg expr or guard are
  evaled only once per discrete step.

redshift 1.1.48

- Added new benchmark framework, and the discrete and constinuous benchmarks.

redshift 1.1.47

- Optimization for 'inert' components.

- More useful interface for Component.state.

redshift 1.1.46

- Resets for links.

redshift 1.1.45

- Resets for constants.

redshift 1.1.44

- Fixed reporting of strictness violations.

- Added test/test_strict_reset_error.rb.

- Outgoing transitions are cached for each state.

redshift 1.1.43

- Optimization for strictly continuous var readers.

redshift 1.1.42

- Added runtime check for strictness violation due to transition to state
  with inconsistent algebraic equation.

redshift 1.1.41

- Added infrastructure for checking strictness and strictness violations
  at run time.

redshift 1.1.40

- Strictness violations of writers can be rescued, and the value remains set.

- Renaned ContinuousAssignmentError to StrictnessError

- World#age removed; use #evolve instead.

- Improved test_strict_continuity.rb.

redshift 1.1.39

- Added World.defaults.

redshift 1.1.38

- Added strict links.
