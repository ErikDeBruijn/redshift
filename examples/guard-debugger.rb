# This example is a simple debugger for stepping through guards. It's not
# intended to be useful as a debugger, but to show how hook methods can be
# used to develop debuggers.
#
# See examples/step-discrete-hook.rb for more examples of hook methods.
#
# See mixins/debugger.rn and examples/debugger.rb for a more useful debugger.
